**ReadMeEditor** is a free, open source note taking / readme editing application, which helps you write and visualize your notes in real time. ReadMeEditor comes with an in-built **Code Editor** so you can seamlessly write your notes in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). ReadMeEditor is available as a **üíª desktop web** application and also comes with **üåì Dark Mode**.

### How to use ReadMeEditor?

- You can generate a starter template for a readme by clicking on the **\`Generate Template\`** button on the NavBar.
- Use the **üìã Note Editor** to write notes in Markdown. ReadMeEditor renders it in real time.
- Directly fetch **Readmes from GitHub** by clicking on the **\`Find from GitHub\`** button. Enter the Username or Organization name, repository and branch name. ReadMeEditor will get the contents of that ReadMe file for you to edit.
- Are you an avid blogger üìî? Use it for **writing blogs** and visualize them on the fly.

## Writing notes in Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. ReadMeEditor supports a Markdown Syntax.

In general, while Markdown is a markup language, it is meant to be human readable, even without being rendered. This is a simple example (you can see how it looks in the viewer panel):

* * *

# Heading

## Sub-heading

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. Text attributes _italic_, **bold** and \`monospace\` are supported. You can create bullet lists:

* apples
* oranges
* pears

Or numbered lists:

1. wash
2. rinse
3. repeat

Or code blocks:

\`\`\`typescript
const count: number = 0;
console.log('Hello World');
\`\`\`

Or Images:

A lot more is possible including adding code samples, math formulae or checkbox lists - see the [Markdown documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for more information.
